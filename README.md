# Express API Project

This weeks project was to create an API using Express with the help of an already hard-coded set of data, stored as a JSON file in your project. The API should have at least a couple of RESTful endpoints which return either an array of data, or a single item.

## The problem

From the beginning this weeks project looked a bit easyer than previous weeks where we worked with react and redux. For me the easy part this week was to understand how to write the code. But I got lost in the the difference between endpoints, routes, params and query and when to use what. And also how to write the paths correct both in the code but also how to write them correct in postman or the browser. This sometimes resulted in me believeing that there where something wrong with my code and I unnecessarily rewrote it...which has been really annoying.

I can't say that I yet fully understand it...

If I hade more time it would been fun to use my API to also do a frontend.
Or try to figure out why my error message dosen't work when searching for book over or below 500 pages.
